# GameBacklogSelector
Randomly picks an installed game for you to play. In an attempt to go through my Steam library, I decided to work with my son on creating a simple random game selector. Currently, this is a very simple console application that scans directories (or drives) supplied as command line parameters, adds all of the executable files to a list, and selects a file at random.
